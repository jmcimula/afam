Test your site

It is important to find and fix Firefox regressions before Firefox users visit your broken site. Mozilla is offering Firefox Developer Edition, formerly known as Aurora, so please use this alpha version on a daily basis to develop and test your site or Web app.
Report issues

Please report any regressions you encountered through one of the following ways:

    Social media: Tweet us the URL of your problematic site. You can also send us a direct message via Twitter or Facebook.
    GitHub: If you have a GitHub account, it might be easy to file a new issue on our repository.
    Bugzilla: If you have Mozillaâ€™s Bugzilla account and can recognize an appropriate component for your issue, file a new bug directly.
